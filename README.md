## Instagram with React, Firebase and TailwindCSS

This application was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Tailwind CSS. I have built the following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard and lastly the user profile page. There are four different pages, some are public and some are private with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.
